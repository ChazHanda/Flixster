### Notes

For the part where we added the youtube library to our project, I wasn't able to directly paste the .jar file like was shown in the video. I pasted the file in the appropriate folder through the file explorer and it was fine. After that, I thought I was having a problem with importing the library, but I was just messing up capitalization in "youTube".

### Notes
When I was at the step where we used the debugger for "onSuccess" or "onFailure" I was getting an error that was making my program land in the "onFailure" state. I re-watched the video to make sure I did everything properly and did some other troubleshooting. It turns out that everything was fine, but I had to uninstall the app on the emulator to fix whatever happened.
I also had an issue where I was using the wrong Github repository and I ended up messing up all my file placements. I resolved this by moving all my code to a new project and pushing that instead.
